# Proj04 - A rest app with your domain



## Pedagogical intent

To get to grips with the delivered code (spring rest api), you'll be asked to choose a domain and apply it to the current project (payroll).

* Update business logic.
* Adapt route naming.
* Check that exceptions are also related to the chosen domain.
* Don't forget directory names, namespaces and the references mentioned in Maven's pom.xml.

## Delivery

* Configure and validate the installation on your team's dedicated instance.
* Complete the installation file in the repository to keep a record of orders carried out.
* Deliver it (documentation) to your repository, in the wiki section.
