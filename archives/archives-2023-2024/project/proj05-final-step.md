## Pedagogical intent

Based on the previous stage of the project, which enabled you to customize your spring rest api app and use Nginx as a reverse proxy, you now need to apply the following evolutions to finalize this first project integrating Docker.

* Split your application into as many microservices as the HTTP verb it uses.
* Ensure data persistence via a single container, enabling your microservices to become stateless (and support scalability)
* Set up an ssh tunnel to your DockerHost.
* Upgrade your reverse proxy to a “simple” gateway app

## Delivery

* Configure and validate the installation on your team's dedicated instance.
* Complete the installation file in the repository to keep a record of orders carried out.
* Deliver it (documentation) to your repository, in the wiki section.
