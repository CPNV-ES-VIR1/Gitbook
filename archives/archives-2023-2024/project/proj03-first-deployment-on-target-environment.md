## Pedagogical intent

Drawing on lab 03 - Run a first container, you are asked to deploy Nginx in a docked version.

* Configure Docker on an integration environment (without the Desktop version),
* Deploy Nginx (standard version),
* Validate port publication,
* Review basic ssh commands for the rest of the project.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will receive the information you need to connect to your Docker Host via a private oneDrive share for your team.
{% endhint %}

## Delivery

* Configure and validate the installation on your team's dedicated instance.
* Complete the installation file in the repository to keep a record of orders carried out.
* Deliver it (documentation) to your repository, in the wiki section.
