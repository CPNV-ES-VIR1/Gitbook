# Proj01 - Vision and Preliminary analysis

## Vision

## Preliminary Analysis

{% hint style="info" %}
The business context is not to be taken into account at all. This is a "typical" infrastructure, which can then be used to meet a wide range of needs.
{% endhint %}

## Pedagogical intent

By observing an infrastructure diagram, deduce:

* the main objective of this infrastructure,
* become familiar with this type of representation,
* deduce a "technical" backlog for successful deployment,
* identify what is clear, and what is not -yet- clear.

## Delivery

Retrieve the markdown from the project module repository, complete it, and deliver it to your repository, in the wiki section.
