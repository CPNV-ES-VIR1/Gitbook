# Lab02 - Run a first app

## Pedagogical intent

In this lab, we'll be taking the application we're going to evolve into our own hands, to discover the Spring architecture, as well as Docker.

## Tasks

Starting from an existing code, we will :

* Run the app locally
* Explore the app
* Docker - First analysis

## Delivery

Retrieve lab 2 content from the lab repository. Read the readme.md file to know how to deal with this lab!
