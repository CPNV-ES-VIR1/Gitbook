# Lab04 - Deploy a spring rest api with Docker

## Pedagogical intent

Pedagogical intent:

This lab will certainly be a little more complex than the previous ones, but it's excellent preparation for the rest of the module project.

Here are the skills trained:

* Discover spring MVC architecture for REST api backend applications,
* Write (update) a Docker file
* Test api calls to your Dockerized application via curl.

## Delivery
